Write a concise changelog for this Flutter plugin release.
- Output only bullet points (no heading; a separate step will add `### <VERSION>`).
- Summarize user-visible changes; do not repeat commit subjects verbatim and do not include commit hashes.
- Keep bullets short; group/reorder if helpful; omit noisy/internal-only changes.
- Keep formatting in Markdown with a simple bullet list and nothing else.
